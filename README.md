## Khajiit Bot (previously GarryBot)

***Khajiit has wares, if you have coin..._***

Disclaimer: This is the original base code used on Khajiit. Since release further development has gone private. I wanted to leave this here as an example of how webscraping and bots can be used together to provide convenient services. If you are a potential employer and would like to see the latest code please email: michael.c.frederic@gmail.com.

Want to add Khajiit to your discord server?

Khajiit searches G2A and Steam, then compares the prices and returns a embedded message with links to both and a price comparison. Use "!game name of game" to search.
